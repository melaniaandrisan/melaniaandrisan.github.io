In 2015 I decided to share what I read, so here is a list with the books I read from 2015 to present. I read recommended books and with a good rating on GoodRead and Amazon. Usually I choose books in Kindle format because I can read them everywhere and every time. I am interesting in good parenting, architecture and management books.
