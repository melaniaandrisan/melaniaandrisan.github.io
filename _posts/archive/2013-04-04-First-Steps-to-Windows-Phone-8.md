title: "Web Development at IT School"
---

Two days ago I had the pleasure to be the Speaker at [ITSchool][1], and event organized by Aiesec for the Timisoara students.

In the classroom(because it was organized in one of the schools) I had a group of very interested students from first to third year at Politehnica Timisoara. After one of our discussions I promised that I will publish a list of resources and places from where to start learning Windows Phone 8 Apps development. You can find my slides on [SlideShare][2].

And here are the first elements:

1. First step is to go to the [Get Started page from MSDN][3] and do install the software described there

2. If you are a C# absolute beginner and you want to start learning it start with the next [videos][4]

3. After you have on your computer everything installed go to [Channel 9 Jump Start Videos][5] and take some time to pass through all the features Windows Phone 8 has

3bis. You can find the videos and the slides also on [Microsoft virtual academy][6]

4. Start doing the [demos][7]

5.  Play by your own and ask the [Stackoverflow][8] community if needed

6. Have an idea and build your own application :)

Have fun and enjoy coding :)



@ My Students: See you next week and I hope you will have the same enthusiasm and a little bit of time to start viewing the previous documentations.
