![ThinkDifferent-Apple_Logo]({{ site.url }}/ThinkDifferent-Apple_Logo.jpg)I am a fan of Apple and Apple products for a long time now. I've seen a lot of videos about them, I read books about Apple and Steve  Jobs and a couple of minutes ago I realized what I really love at them; They appreciate the innovation, the game changers and the ones that are creasy enough to think they can [change the world][2].  And also how they choose their people:

##### "WE HIRE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD." Steve Jobs

There are a lot of videos that I like. The Steve's [Stanford University Speech][3] is one of them.

And this is the commercial that I appreciate to most: [The creasy ones][4].

With this lines:

> " Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
>
> The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
>
> About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.
>
> Maybe they have to be crazy.
>
> How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
>
> We make tools for these kinds of people.
>
> While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. "

Another list of videos about "Think different" are also [here][5].

They are just the tools and we are the drivers. They gave us what we need to make incredible things, and now it is our part to make something special, something that makes the difference.
