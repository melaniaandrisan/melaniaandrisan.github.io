![devSum Speaker][1]

This year started with a lot of new things for me and my presents at [DevSum][2] is one of them. A thought a lot of what I want to present there and one of the things was [LightSwitch][3]. LightSwitch is one of these technologies at Microsoft which evolved a lot. They started with a LightSwitch in Silverlight and step by step it changed to HTML 5.

I know about LightSwitch from the beginning because I was a Silverlight developer and learn almost everything about it when it was alive:)… but ya, it is not here anymore and the HTML 5 is the present and the future.

I liked LightSwitch because it is a way to do fast business applications without thinking to much on the code but focus on the requirements, UI and user interaction.

So…In the next weeks I will build step by step a LightSwitch application which in the end will be used by the community and presented to you at DevSum, see you there.
