title: "Day 3 - Learning Markdown"
---

Today I started learning Markdown, a pretty cool language fast and easy to learn.

Here are some helpful links:  
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)  
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  
[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)  
[Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - I liked this one because is interactive and learning by doing is the best.

My personal notes from today:  


~~~
** for bold
_ for italic
# for header
(link title)[link]

[link][reference link]
[reference link]: the actual link

![image title](image url)
- the reference link works also for images

> quote in front of a paragraph

* unordered list

1. ... 2... ordered list

2 spaces to have new line  - one enter in not enough
2 enters is a new paragraph  

~~~

A short personal note: It looks like the known ``` is not working for code snippets, so I used ~~~.

P.S. I am using Atom as an editor and I have also Markdown Preview using `CTRL+ALT+M`
