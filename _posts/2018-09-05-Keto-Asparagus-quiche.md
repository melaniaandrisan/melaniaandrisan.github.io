title: "Keto Asparagus Zucchini Quiche"

---

I love to bake and I love vegetables so the vegetable quiche is the perfect combination. 
This one is "cheesy" because of the nutritional yeast and a little bit sweet from the onions and has a little bit of crunch from the asparagus.

**Prep Time**: 40 minutes

**Cook time**: 35 minutes

**Servings**: 8 slices
