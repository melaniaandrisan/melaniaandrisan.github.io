## And I started to edit my technical blog

My first step was to read about [Static Sites Generators](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/static-site-generators.csp) writen by  Brian Rinaldi. After one hour and some playing time wihh my little one I started creating my repository on [github](https://github.com/), write a **jekyll new .** and have my github.io website localy. Interesting enough it took me a while to realize that the name of the reposity should be melaniaandrisan.github.io not only melaniaandrisan. :)

Now I have it. Looking forward to the new challenge.
