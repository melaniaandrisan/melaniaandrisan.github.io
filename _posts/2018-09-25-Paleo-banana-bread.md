---
        
### Ingredients

- 3 big bananas frozen or fresh
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 almond butter
- 1/2 peanut butter
- 3/4 teaspoons backing powder
- 1/4 teaspoons nutmeg
- 2/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F or 180 C
2. Put the bananas and the eggs in a blender and mix till smooth
3. Add all the other ingredients and mix well
4. Put them in a 5/9 tray 
5. Bake for 55 minutes or till your tooth pick is clean(I checked around 40 minutes and it was not done at all - probably if you have fresh bananas at 40 minutes will be already done)
