This bread is one of my little girl's favorites. Is fluffy, moist, with a thin crust and easy to handle by her small hands.

**Prep Time**: 5 minutes

**Cook time**:
- 50-55 minutes for frozen bananas
- 40-45 minutes for fresh ones

**Servings**: 12 slices

### Utensils
- blender (or a fork and a wisk)
- large bowl 
- measuring cups
- measuring spoons
- spatula
- baking tray 9x5 inch
- parchment paper (or butter for the tray)

### Ingredients
- 3 big bananas frozen or fresh
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup nut butter (which one you like, I chose almond and chunky peanut butter)
  - 1/2 almond butter 
  - 1/2 peanut butter
- 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoons nutmeg
- 2/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C, place the parchment paper in the tray
2. Put the bananas and the eggs in a blender and mix until smooth
3. Add all the other ingredients and mix well
4. Put the mix in a 9/5 tray and add the tray in the preheated oven
5. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean (I checked at around 40 minutes and it was not done at all - probably if you have fresh bananas at 40 minutes it will be already be done)

### Serve
We love it warmed up a little with some butter on top or just plain, is just delicios and perfect for an autumn evening with a nice cup of tea.

### Store
You can store it in an airtight container for up to 3 days in the fridge or slice it and put it in the freezer for up to 3 months.
