I started this blog to learn to build a blog using static sites and to make it as beautiful and useful as I can.

The scope is to learn all this technologies, to become a better writer and a better developer and a better architect.

I am an architect which likes challenges, so this new year challenge is to learn every week something new related to web development(css, js, ajax, html...) and a lot more related to technologies.

So lets see the power of `Jekyll`.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
