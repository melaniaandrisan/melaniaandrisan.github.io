A year and a half ago I lost my Wordpress data base for mela.ro and now I am trying to restore all my blog posts and to have them here.

The current solution is:  

* Get the post from web Archive
* Copy it into http://heckyesmarkdown.com/ check the readability and press go
* Copy the markdown with copy&paste into Atom (because their copy is not working properly)
* Check the markdown and correct the links
* Add the images into Jekyll project

I am trying to optimize this process but for the moment this is everything I got.
